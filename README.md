Filtrex is an elixir library for parsing and querying with filter data structures and parameters. It allows construction of Ecto queries from Phoenix-like query parameters or map data structures for saving smart filters. It has been tested using the Postrgres adapter but will likely work with other adapters as well.

\*\*Note: **See the [v0.1.0 README](https://github.com/rcdilorenzo/filtrex/blob/b4a6830aafc6907a82b296392bb91432ed8e9024/README.md) for the latest Hex.pm release. This README is the documentation for the upcoming 0.2.0 version.**

## Parsing Filters from URL Params

```elixir
config = %{text: %{keys: ~w(title comments)}, date: %{keys: ~w(posted_at)}
params = %{
    "comments_contains" => "JosÃ©",
    "title" => "Upcoming Elixir Features",
    "posted_at_between" => %{"start" => "2013-01-01", "end" => "2017-12-31"}
}

{:ok, filter} = Filtrex.parse_params(config, params)
query = Filtrex.query(filter, YourApp.YourModel)

```

Using parsed parameters from your phoenix application, a filter can be easily constructed with type validation and custom comparators. 


## Parsing Filter Structures

```elixir
config = %{text: %{keys: ~w(title comments)}, date: %{keys: ~w(due_date)}

{:ok, filter} = Filtrex.parse(config, %{
  filter: %{
    type: "all",               # all | any | none
    conditions: [
      %{column: "title", comparator: "contains", value: "Buy", type: "text"},
      %{column: "title", comparator: "does not contain", value: "Milk", type: "text"}
    ],
    sub_filters: [%{
      filter: %{
        type: "any",
        conditions: [
          %{column: "due_date", comparator: "in the last", value: %{interval: "days", amount: 4}, type: "date"}
        ]
      }
    }]
  }
}
```


The configuration passed into `Filtrex.parse/2` gives the individual condition types more information to validate the filter against and is a required argument. See [this section](http://rcdilorenzo.github.io/filtrex/Filtrex.html) of the documentation for details.

To create an [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto) query, simple construct a query like the following and then pipe it into oblivion!

```elixir
Filtrex.query(filter, YourApp.YourModel)
```

The [documentation](http://rcdilorenzo.github.io/filtrex) is filled with valuable information on how to both use and extend the library to your liking so please take a look!

## Filter Types

The following condition types and comparators are supported.

* [Filtrex.Condition.Text](http://rcdilorenzo.github.io/filtrex/Filtrex.Condition.Text.html)
    * is, is not, equals, does not equal, contains, does not contain
* [Filtrex.Condition.Date](http://rcdilorenzo.github.io/filtrex/Filtrex.Condition.Date.html)
    * after, on or after, before, on or before, between, not between, in the last, not in the last, in the next, not in the next, equals, does not equal, is, is not

## Installation (once v0.2.0 is available)

The package is available on [Hex](https://hex.pm) and can be installed by adding it to your list of dependencies:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:filtrex, "~> 0.2.0"}]
end
```
